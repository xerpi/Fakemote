# *_fakemote_*
_A Wii cIOS module that fakes Wiimotes from the input of USB game controllers._

## Features

### Supported USB game controllers
|       Device Name        | Vendor Name | Vendor ID | Product ID |
|:------------------------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| PlayStation 3 Controller | Sony Corp.  |   054c    |    0268    |
| DualShock 4 [CUH-ZCT1x]  | Sony Corp.  |   054c    |    05c4    |
| DualShock 4 [CUH-ZCT2x]  | Sony Corp.  |   054c    |    09cc    |
|   DualSense Controller   | Sony Corp.  |   054c    |    0ce6    |

- DS3, DS4 and DualSense support includes LEDs, rumble, and the accelerometer
- DS4 and DualSense's touchpad is used to emulate the Wiimote IR Camera pointer
- All controllers emulate a Wiimote with the Nunchuk and Classic Controller extensions connected. Press L1+L3 to switch between them
- Three IR pointer emulation modes: direct (touchpad, only for DS4 and DualSense), analog axis relative (move the pointer with the right analog) and analog axis absolute (the pointer is moved proportionally to the right analog starting from the center). Press R1+R3 to switch between them

## Installation
1) Download [d2x cIOS Installer for regular Wii](https://wii.guide/cios.html)/[d2x cIOS Installer for vWii](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/#/vwii-modding) and extract it to the SD card
2) Copy `FAKEMOTE.app` to the d2x cIOS Installer directory that contains the modules of the cIOS version you want to install.  
   For example, for `d2x-v10-beta52` copy `FAKEMOTE.app` to `sd:/apps/d2x-cIOS-Installer-Wii/v10/beta52/d2x-v10-beta52`
3) Open d2x cIOS Installer's `ciosmaps.xml` (located at `sd:/apps/d2x-cIOS-Installer-Wii/ciosmaps.xml`) and do the following:
   1) Locate the line containing the base IOS version you want to install. It starts with `<base ios=`.  
      For base IOS 57:
      ```xml
      <base ios="57" version="5918" contentscount="26" modulescount="7">
      ```
   3) Increase `modulescount` and `contentscount` by 1.  
      For base IOS 57:
      ```xml
      <base ios="57" version="5918" contentscount="27" modulescount="8">
      ```
   3) Add a `<content>` entry for `FAKEMOTE`after the last `<content module>`.  
      For base IOS 57:
      ```xml
      <content id="0x24" module="FAKEMOTE" tmdmoduleid="-1"/>
      ```
4) Run d2x cIOS Installer and install the cIOS

## Usage
- If you have a **regular Wii**, **not a Wii U (vWii)**, you can install [Priiloader](https://wii.guide/priiloader.html) and change the IOS slot to use when running System Menu and disc games
- You can configure your USB loader to specify the IOS slot to use when running the loader and/or games

## Notes
- This has only been tested with base IOS 57 and 58
- Use base IOS 58 to have compatibility with both USB ports
- This is still in beta-stage, therefore it might not work as expected

## Compilation
1) Download and install [devkitARM](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
2) Install `stripios`:
   1) Download `stripios`'s source code from [Leseratte's d2xl cIOS](https://github.com/Leseratte10/d2xl-cios/tree/master/stripios)
   2) Compile it:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o stripios
   ```
   4) Install it:
   ```bash
   cp stripios $DEVKITPRO/tools/bin
   ```
3) Run `make` to compile `FAKEMOTE.app`
